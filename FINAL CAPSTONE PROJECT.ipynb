    "\"Advertising plays an important role in increasing and decreasing demand for a product or service. It's a way to engage consumers and educate them about the business, product or service and results. If the advertising is targeting the audience segment correctly, then the effects on demand will likely be positive. However, if the advertising misses the mark, the effects on the business can be devastating. Advertising can affect both the demand for a particular product or service, and the demand within a particular audience segment.\"\n",

    "Undoubtedly, Business with good advertising easily flourish is an of an ethnically diverse city. The idea of this project is to categorically segment the neighborhoods(towns) of Washington into major clusters to advice a new restaurant chains share holders on where to set-up advertising on their new online restaurant.  A desirable intention is to examine the neighborhood cluster's food habits. Further examination might reveal the neighborhoods food preference to help the company draft targeted menus.\n",

    "This project will help to understand the diversity of a neighborhood by leveraging venue data from Foursquare’s ‘Places API’ and ‘k-means clustering’ machine learning algorithm. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) will help to discover further about the culture and diversity of the neighborhood.\n",
    "Stakeholders would be the one who are interested to use this quantifiable analysis to decide the distribution of advertising over \"the most visited city on the US - Washington\". "
